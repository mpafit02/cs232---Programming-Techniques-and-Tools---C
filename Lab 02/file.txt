The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.
How lazy was he?  Well, he was pretty darn lazy, I'll tell you.
And speaking of the fox, why was he jumping over dogs anyways?
He just leaped his 123rd dog.  
Didn't he have anything better to do with his time?
When he checked his watch at 12:45 PM, 15 more foxes jumped over
the lazy dog, who so far had dreamed of chasing 100 sheep, 17 cats,
2 rabbits, and 13 mailmen.
